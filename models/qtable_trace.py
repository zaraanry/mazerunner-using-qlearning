        The layout of the maze and the rules how to move through it are called the environment. An agent is placed
        at start_cell. The agent chooses actions (move left/right/up/down) in order to reach the exit_cell. Every
        action results in a reward or penalty which are accumulated during the game. Every move gives a small
        penalty (-0.05), returning to a cell the agent visited earlier a bigger penalty(-0.25) and running into
        a wall a large penalty (-0.75). The reward (+2.0) is collected when the agent reaches the exit. The
        game always reaches a terminal state; the agent either wins or looses. Obviously reaching the exit means
        winning, but if the penalties the agent is collecting during play exceed a certain threshold the agent is
        assumed to wander around cluelessly and looses.

        A note on cell coordinates:
        The cells in the maze are stored as (col, row) or (x, y) tuples. (0, 0) is the upper left corner of the maze.
        This way of storing coordinates is in line with what matplotlibs plot() function expects as inputs. The maze
        itself is stored as a 2D numpy array so cells are accessed via [row, col]. To convert a (col, row) tuple
        to (row, col) use: (col, row)[::-1]

        The layout of the maze and the rules how to move through it are called the environment. An agent is placed
        at start_cell. The agent chooses actions (move left/right/up/down) in order to reach the exit_cell. Every
        action results in a reward or penalty which are accumulated during the game. Every move gives a small
        penalty (-0.05), returning to a cell the agent visited earlier a bigger penalty(-0.25) and running into
        a wall a large penalty (-0.75). The reward (+2.0) is collected when the agent reaches the exit. The
        game always reaches a terminal state; the agent either wins or looses. Obviously reaching the exit means
        winning, but if the penalties the agent is collecting during play exceed a certain threshold the agent is
        assumed to wander around cluelessly and looses.

        A note on cell coordinates:
        The cells in the maze are stored as (col, row) or (x, y) tuples. (0, 0) is the upper left corner of the maze.
        This way of storing coordinates is in line with what matplotlibs plot() function expects as inputs. The maze
        itself is stored as a 2D numpy array so cells are accessed via [row, col]. To convert a (col, row) tuple
        to (row, col) use: (col, row)[::-1]

        The layout of the maze and the rules how to move through it are called the environment. An agent is placed
        at start_cell. The agent chooses actions (move left/right/up/down) in order to reach the exit_cell. Every
        action results in a reward or penalty which are accumulated during the game. Every move gives a small
        penalty (-0.05), returning to a cell the agent visited earlier a bigger penalty(-0.25) and running into
        a wall a large penalty (-0.75). The reward (+2.0) is collected when the agent reaches the exit. The
        game always reaches a terminal state; the agent either wins or looses. Obviously reaching the exit means
        winning, but if the penalties the agent is collecting during play exceed a certain threshold the agent is
        assumed to wander around cluelessly and looses.

        A note on cell coordinates:
        The cells in the maze are stored as (col, row) or (x, y) tuples. (0, 0) is the upper left corner of the maze.
        This way of storing coordinates is in line with what matplotlibs plot() function expects as inputs. The maze
        itself is stored as a 2D numpy array so cells are accessed via [row, col]. To convert a (col, row) tuple
        to (row, col) use: (col, row)[::-1]

        For every state (here: the agents current location ) the value for each of the actions is stored in a table.
        The key for this table is (state + action). Initially all values are 0. When playing training games
        after every move the value in the table is updated based on the reward gained after making the move. Training
        ends after a fixed number of games, or earlier if a stopping criterion is reached (here: a 100% win rate).

        To speed up learning the model keeps track of the (state, action) pairs which have been visited before and
        also updates their values based on the current reward (a.k.a. eligibility trace). With every step the amount
        in which previous values are updated decays.
